# validOS - nullOS v2

## What is ValidOS?

ValidOS (or validOS) is a webOS that's built off of anshnk/nullOS. nullOS was dropped since ansh had other projects to work on, but I suppose I'll continue it for fun :)

## Self-Hosting

Self hosing is super simple, just clone the repo!

Requirements:

-   Recent version of Node.JS
-   NPM

Clone the repo into `~/validOS`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LolzTheDev/validOS.git validOS
```

Install dependancies

```sh
cd validOS && npm i
```

Run the server

```sh
npm run valid
```

And there you go!
